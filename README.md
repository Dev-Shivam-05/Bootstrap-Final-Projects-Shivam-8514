- Mobile-first responsive breakpoints (Bootstrap utilities)  
- Semantic HTML (header/main/section/figure)

- Separate concerns: CSS in `css/`, JS in `js/`, assets in `images/`

---

## 🔧 Want to customize?
- Change theme colors using CSS variables inside `css/`  
- Swap out hero images in `images/` to brand the page instantly
